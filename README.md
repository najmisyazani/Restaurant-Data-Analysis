## The project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about restaurants to identify and recommend the best ones. Key steps included:

- **Data Preparation:** Imported necessary libraries and datasets, inspected the structure, and cleaned the data by handling missing values and duplicates.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted various analyses to understand the data distribution, such as identifying the cities with the most and least restaurants, franchises with the most national presence, and the distribution of ratings.

- **Insights and Visualizations:** Examined the relationship between several factors like the number of cuisines offered, table booking availability, online delivery options, and aggregate ratings. Created visualizations to illustrate these relationships and derive insights.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Analyzed correlations between different variables like cost, rating, and votes to understand their interdependencies and impact on restaurant performance.
