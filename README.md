This repository consists of the Python writeup in the form of pdf as well as the Jupyter notebook which contains the writeup. The pre-processed dataset that was used in the analysis has also been uploaded.

The project aimed to analyze a dataset containing information about restaurants to identify and recommend the best ones. Key steps included:

Data Preparation: Imported necessary libraries and datasets, inspected the structure, and cleaned the data by handling missing values and duplicates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted various analyses to understand the data distribution, such as identifying the cities with the most and least restaurants, franchises with the most national presence, and the distribution of ratings.

Insights and Visualizations: Examined the relationship between several factors like the number of cuisines offered, table booking availability, online delivery options, and aggregate ratings. Created visualizations to illustrate these relationships and derive insights.

Statistical Analysis: Analyzed correlations between different variables like cost, rating, and votes to understand their interdependencies and impact on restaurant performance.
